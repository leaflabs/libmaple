Static
======

The static keyword is used to create variables that are visible to
only one function. However unlike local variables that get created
and destroyed every time a function is called, static variables
persist beyond the function call, preserving their data between
function calls.



Variables declared as static will only be created and initialized
the first time a function is called.

    /* RandomWalk
    * Paul Badger 2007
    * RandomWalk wanders up and down randomly between two
    * endpoints. The maximum move in one loop is governed by
    * the parameter "stepsize".
    * A static variable is moved up and down a random amount.
    * This technique is also known as "pink noise" and "drunken walk".
