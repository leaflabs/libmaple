/* The series header must define:
 *
 * - FLASH_SAFE_WAIT_STATES, the smallest number of wait states that
 *   it is safe to use when SYSCLK is at its fastest documented rate
 *   and the MCU is powered at 3.3V (i.e. this doesn't consider
 *   overclocking or low voltage operation).
 *
 * - The following bit flags, for flash_enable_features():
 *
 *       -- FLASH_PREFETCH: prefetcher
 *       -- FLASH_ICACHE: instruction cache
 *       -- FLASH_DCACHE: data cache
 *
 *   If the target doesn't provide a feature (e.g. instruction and
 *   data caches on the STM32F1), the flag should be set to some no-op
 *   value. This allows using these flags unconditionally, with the
 *   desired effect taking place on series that support them.
