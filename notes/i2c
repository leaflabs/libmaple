We'll probably want both HardwareI2C and SoftI2C implementations, with the
soft being bitbanged on arbitrary pins (and possibly only master-mode; almost
certainly not multi-master).

The first simple implementation will support up to 400khz operation, only 
7-bit addresses, no clock stretching (on our part), only blocking master
read/write (with timeout), and only master n-write,n-read combined messages.

A more advanced implementation would be event-driven, support DMA, higher
clock speeds, handle error interrupts, etc. 

Should all of these return a status code? or just fail? or fail silently?

Ring buffers etc are not needed because the length of the read/write is always
known (or handled by the application code for slave mode).

// port = {1,2}
i2c_init(port, freq)
i2c_disable(port)

// blocking/polling
i2c_master_read(port, slave_addr, *data, len)  // wrapper around writeread
i2c_master_write(port, slave_addr, *data, len) // wrapper around writeread
i2c_master_writeread(port, slave_addr, *wdata, wlen, *rdata, rlen)

// callbacks/interrupts
i2c_slave_set_addr(port, addr) // enables callbacks etc if they aren't already;
                               // set ACK high
i2c_slave_set_rx_callback(port, *function) // takes a byte?
i2c_slave_set_tx_callback(port, *function) // gives a byte?

How to init:
 - setup pins
 - setup peripheral input clock: 4MHz for fast mode
 - configure clock control registers
 - configure rise time register
 - configure interrupts
 - configure I2C_CR1 to enable the peripheral
 - set ACK flag low: won't be a slave until addr is set

How to master_write:
 - START, addr[0:7], W, ACK, DATA[0:7], ACK, DATA[8:15], ..., STOP
 - software sets START high, which toggles M/SL to master mode
 - when START actually happens, SB is set and interrupt happens; hardware
   waits until address is written to DR
 - address shifts out and an interrupt is thrown with ADDR high; if LSB of
   address was low, in transmitter mode. TRA reflects this
 - software writes to the first byte to DR and clears ADDR
 - first byte shifts out and when there's an ACK an interrupt is thrown
   with TxE high; if no new byte was written to DR since the previous
   transmission BTF goes high
 - software writes next byte to DR and clears BTF, or sets STOP bit to end
   data transmission, or sets START to begin next part of combined session
 - after STOP is set, hardware goes back to slave mode

How to master_read:
 - START, addr[0:7], R, ACK, DATA[0:7], ACK, ..., NACK, DATA[-8:-1], STOP
 - software sets START high, which toggles M/SL to master mode
 - when START actually happens, SB is set and interrupt happens; hardware
   waits until address is written to DR
 - address shifts out and an interrupt is thrown with ADDR high; if LSB of
   address was high, in receiver mode. TRA reflects this.
 - software clears ADDR; hardware shifts in first byte from slave and sends ACK
   if ACK is set. interrupt is thrown with RxNE high, with BTF set
 - if only reading one byte, ACK should be set low and STOP high; hardware will
   then NACK and STOP after reading
 - software reads from DR and clears BTF bit. next byte is shifted in
 - software sets NACK low after second-to-last byte is read by setting ACK low
   after reading from DR, and either setting STOP or START high
 - after STOP is set, hardware goes back to slave mode

How to master_writeread:
 - [START, addr[0:7], W, ACK, WDATA[0:7], ...], 
   [START, addr[0:7], R, ACK, RDATA[0:7], ACK, ..., NACK, RDATA[-8:-1]]
   STOP
 - implement the above read/write but set START high instead of STOP high at
   the end

How to slave tx (master read):
 - if address is matched, ACK is send (if ACK flag is high) and ADDR goes high;
   event interrupt is triggered if ITEVFEN flag is set. TRA indicates whether
   this is a read or write request
 - program sets DR degister and clears ADDR flag; hardware will clock stretch
   until ADDR is low
 - if ITVENFEN and ITBUFEN are set, the TxE interrupt is triggered after the
   byte is sent and the master ACKs. now the hardware stretches until BTF is
   cleared before sending again.
 - after the STOP is sent, hardware sets STOPF, throws an event if ITEVFEN is
   high, and waits for a read of SR1 and write CR1

How to slave rx (master write):
 - if address is matched, ACK is send (if ACK flag is high) and ADDR goes high;
   event interrupt is triggered if ITEVFEN flag is set. TRA indicates whether
   this is a read or write request
 - the hardware shifts in the byte to DR and sends an ACK if ACK flag is high
 - if ITEVFEN and ITBUFEN are set, an RxNE interrupt is sent. hardware waits
   until the BTF flag is reset
 - after the STOP is sent, hardware sets STOPF, throws an event if ITEVFEN is
   high, and waits for a read of SR1 and write CR1

i2c General Reference ---------------------------------------------------------

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I²C

4 modes/roles for a given device. These designations are transaction specific;
a device can switch roles from one transaction to the next:
    master transmit
    master receive
    slave transmit
    slave receive


STM32 Specific Reference ------------------------------------------------------

see stm32 docs: reference manual (doc 13902 rev10) pg637/1003

see STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Lib_V3.2.0/Project/STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Examples/I2C/Interrupt for an example project (reading/writing between the two i2c buses) based on the stm32library

>100khz is "fast mode", which goes up to 400khz. stm32 supports up to 400khz.
    things are different in fast mode: 4mhz input clock

interrupts see pg652/1003
registers see pg654/1003

PEC = packet error checking. don't think this is i2c standard

each i2c port has an error and an event interrupt 

the stm32 is in slave mode by default; it enters master only when executing
a request
