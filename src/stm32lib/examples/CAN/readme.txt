Example description
===================
This example provides a description of how to set a communication with the bxCAN
in loopback mode.

The CAN cell first performs a transmission and a reception of a standard data
frame by polling at 100 Kbits/s. The received frame is checked and some LEDs light
up to indicate whether the communication was successful. Then, an extended data
frame is transmitted at 500 Kbits/s. Reception is done in the interrupt handler
when the message becomes pending in the FIFO. Finally, the LEDs indicate if both
transmission and reception have been successful.


Directory contents
==================
platform_config.h    Hardware configuration header file
stm32f10x_conf.h     Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.c       Interrupt handlers
stm32f10x_it.h       Interrupt handlers header file
main.c               Main program


Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.
To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, uncomment
the corresponding line in platform_config.h file.

 + STM3210B-EVAL 
    - Use LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds connected respectively to PC.06, PC.07, PC.08
      and PC.09 pins
 
 + STM3210E-EVAL
    - Use LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds connected respectively to PF.06, PF0.7, PF.08
      and PF.09 pins


How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_can.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
    
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
