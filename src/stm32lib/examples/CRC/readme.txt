Example description
===================
This example shows how to use CRC (cyclic redundancy check) calculation unit to 
get a CRC code of a given buffer of data word(32-bit), based on a fixed generator
polynomial(0x4C11DB7).


Directory contents
==================
stm32f10x_conf.h  Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.c    Interrupt handlers
stm32f10x_it.h    Header for stm32f10x_it.c
main.c            Main program


Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.

    
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
  + stm32f10x_crc.c           
    
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
