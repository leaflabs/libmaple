Example description
===================
This example shows how to modify CortexM3 Thread mode privilege access and stack.
CortexM3 Thread mode is entered on Reset, and can be entered as a result of an
exception return.  

The associated program is used to:
1. Switch the Thread mode stack from Main stack to Process stack
2. Switch the Thread mode from Privileged to Unprivileged
3. Switch the Thread mode from Unprivileged back to Privileged

To monitor the stack used and the privileged or unprivileged access level of code
in Thread mode, a set of variables is available within the program. It is also
possible to use the 'Cortex register' window of the debugger.


Directory contents
==================
stm32f10x_conf.h  Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.c    Interrupt handlers
stm32f10x_it.h    Header for stm32f10x_it.c
main.c            Main program


Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.

    
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c           
    
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
