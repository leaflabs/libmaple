Example description
===================
This example provides a description of how to use two DMA channels to transfer a 
data buffer from memory to I2C2 through I2C1.
I2C1 is set as the master transmitter and I2C2 as the slave receiver. DMA1 Channel5 is
configured to store the data received from I2C2 into the Rx buffer (reception buffer).
DMA1 Channel6 is configured to transfer data from the Tx buffer (transmission buffer) to
the I2C1 DR register. After the generation of the Start condition and once the slave
address has been acknowledged, DMA capability is enabled for both I2C1 and I2C2. As soon as the
two I2C DMAEN bits are set in the I2C1_CR2 and I2C2_CR2 registers, the transmission of
the Tx buffer is started by DMA1 Channel5 and at the same time the data received on
I2C2 is stored in Rx buffer using DMA1 Channel6 . The transmitted and the received buffers
are compared to check that all data have been correctly transferred.


Directory contents
==================
stm32f10x_conf.h  Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.c    Interrupt handlers
stm32f10x_it.h    Interrupt handlers header file
main.c            Main program


Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.

 - Connect I2C1 SCL pin (PB.06) to I2C2 SCL pin (PB.10)
 - Connect I2C1 SDA pin (PB.07) to I2C2 SDA pin	(PB.11)
 - Check that a pull-up resistor is connected on one I2C SDA pin
 - Check that a pull-up resistor is connected on one I2C SCL pin
      

How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_dma.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_i2c.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
    
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
