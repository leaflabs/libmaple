Example description
===================
This example provides a description of how to program the STM32F10x FLASH.

After Reset, the Flash memory Program/Erase Controller is locked. To unlock it,
the FLASH_Unlock function is used.
Before programming the desired addresses, an erase operation is performed using 
the flash erase page feature. The erase procedure starts with the calculation of
the number of pages to be used. Then all these pages will be erased one by one by
calling FLASH_ErasePage function. 

Once this operation is finished, the programming operation will be performed by 
using the FLASH_ProgramWord function. The written data is then checked and the
result of the programming operation is stored into the MemoryProgramStatus variable.


Directory contents
==================
platform_config.h  Evaluation board specific configuration file
stm32f10x_conf.h   Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.h     Interrupt handlers header file
stm32f10x_it.c     Interrupt handlers
main.c             Main program

Note: "#define _FLASH_PROG" should be uncommented in the stm32f10x_conf.h file


Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.
To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, uncomment
the corresponding line in platform_config.h file.
  
  
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files:
  + stm32F10x_lib.c
  + stm32F10x_flash.c
  + stm32F10x_rcc.c
  + stm32F10x_nvic.c

- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
