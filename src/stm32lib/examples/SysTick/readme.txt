Example description
===================

This example shows how to configure the SysTick to generate a time base equal to
1 ms. The system clock is set to 72 MHz, the SysTick is clocked by the AHB clock
(HCLK) divided by 8.

A "Delay" function is implemented based on the SysTick end-of-count event.
Four LEDs connected to the GPIO_LED Pin 6, Pin 7, Pin 8 and Pin 9 are toggled
with a timing defined by the Delay function.


Directory contents
==================
platform_config.h    Evaluation board specific configuration file
stm32f10x_conf.h     Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.c       Interrupt handlers
stm32f10x_it.h       Header for stm32f10x_it.c
main.c               Main program
main.h               Header for main.c


Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.
To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, uncomment
the corresponding line in platform_config.h file.

 + STM3210B-EVAL 
    - Use LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds connected respectively to PC.06, PC.07, PC.08
      and PC.09 pins
 
 + STM3210E-EVAL
    - Use LD1, LD2, LD3 and LD4 leds connected respectively to PF.06, PF0.7, PF.08
      and PF.09 pins
         
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files:
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
  + stm32f10x_systick.c
  
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
