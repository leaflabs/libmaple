Example description
===================
This example provides a basic communication between USART1 and USART2 using flags.
First, the USART1 sends TxBuffer to USART2. The USART2 reads the received data and
store it into RxBuffer.
The received data is then compared with the send ones and the result of this 
comparison is stored in the "TransferStatus" variable.   

USART1 and USART2 configured as follow:
  - BaudRate = 230400 baud  
  - Word Length = 8 Bits
  - One Stop Bit
  - Even parity
  - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
  - Receive and transmit enabled


Directory contents
==================
platform_config.h    Evaluation board specific configuration file
stm32f10x_conf.h     Library Configuration file
stm32f10x_it.h       Interrupt handlers header file
stm32f10x_it.c       Interrupt handlers
main.c               Main program


Hardware environment
====================
This example runs on STMicroelectronics STM3210B-EVAL and STM3210E-EVAL evaluation
boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware.
To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, uncomment
the corresponding line in platform_config.h file.

 + STM3210B-EVAL 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between CN5 and CN6.
    - Note: in this case USART2 Tx and Rx pins are remapped by software on 
            PD.05 and PD.06 respectively. 
 
 + STM3210E-EVAL
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between CN12 and CN8.
  
  
How to use it
=============
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all your toolchain's start-up files
- Compile the directory content files and required Library files :
  + stm32f10x_lib.c
  + stm32f10x_usart.c
  + stm32f10x_gpio.c
  + stm32f10x_nvic.c
  + stm32f10x_rcc.c
  + stm32f10x_flash.c
  
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example
